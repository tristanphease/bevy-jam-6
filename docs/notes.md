Chain Reaction

# Plan

- ~~Tower defense game with cards? Get cards by collecting them around the map and use them to defeat enemies?~~
- ~~Tower attack game where you attack a tower and try to cause chain reactions with physics to get it to fall down?~~
- Simple 2d platformer where you swing off of chains to progress
